## central service

* distributes hash table :\
* recieves log data 
* sorts providers by various stats and metadata
* is a tracker?
* interface for picking nodes by stats and metadata, with a downloadable module configuration
* bespoke svg map picker now, peermaps later?
* charges nodes to list; bundles optimized, balanced, reliable nodes

## provider nodes

* can set own prices, and publicize some small amount of advertisement in metadata
* easily addressable
* can form peer node mafias, similar to a mining pool 
* possible built-in referal payment system for open affiliations and automatic incentive for infinte blob increase
* is a tracker?  This would increase public torrent trackers by a lot.

## user module

* preconfigures methods 
* can set password, what about key encryption?
* can be used independently, in own subnets, etc

## payment

* direct payments from users to node operators and node headquarters: where all the lil nodes do the real work behind santa segfault as a service's INFINITE.CHRISTMAS
